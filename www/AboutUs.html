          In Jalisco, the craft industry suffers from adverce conditions, because this market is non-profitable, according to our studies. As a consequence, there is a lack of cultural knowledge, lack of support, and the absence of handcrafts in a fair trade; making the artisans to have a poor personal, social and economic development. KOUA is a mobile application that aims to create an easy, educational and fast link between Mexican artisans and buyers through a platform with cultural information and photographs of the different articles. 
            The goal of KOUA is to encourage the purchase and sale of Mexican handcrafts. </p>

           <p> We hope that you enjoy the app, as well as it is helpful for all of you.  </p>
